## **Current Profession**

I'm currently working as a PhD student in the [Pinhassi lab](https://lnu.se/en/staff/jarone.pinhassi/) at Linnaeus University in Kamar (Sweden), in the field of aquatic microbial ecology.

## **Research Focus**

The main focus of my current research is to investigate the role of marine bacterioplankton in carbon cycling by deciphering the genetic basis for organic carbon utilization. Dissolved organic carbon (DOC) derived from phytoplankton photosynthesis represents the main biologically available organic carbon pool in the ocean. The uptake and utilization of organic carbon compounds is largely determined by the metabolic potential encoded in the genomes of marine bacteria, although molecular detail on how they impact on particular element cycles remain largely unknown.

My research is based on state-of-the-art techniques in microbiology, microbial ecology and molecular biology such as metagenomic and metatranscriptomic and mainly based on field studies, microcosm and mesocosm experiments.

I'm personally interested in **natural microbial assemblages** and curious about the **functional role** of microbes and the underlying **phylogenetic information** (What do they do? & Who is doing it?):

- if exposed to various **labile dissolved organic matter (LDOM)** model compounds (see <a href="project1.html">**DOM project**</a>),
- between different stages in a phytoplankton bloom (see <a href="project2.html">**ENVISION project**</a>)
- in different water masses in a **strongly stratified water column** (see <a href="project3.html">**KB project**</a>)
- in the **interactions** between **Bacteria and Eukaryotes** (see <a href="project4.html">**LMO project**</a>) and <a href="project5.html">**Collaboration**</a>)
- in the **interaction** between **microbes and Zooplankton** derived **DOM** (see <a href="project6.html">**Collaboration**</a>)

## **Intensions & Aims of Outreach**

This webpage should provide knowledge about the importance of microorganisms based on my own research activities in the frame of my PhD-thesis. I'm aiming on presenting scientific content about ongoing research, by aiming on summarising results in an understandable form and communicating basic concepts and new findings and the relevance of them with society. A part of academia which is to my personal feeling still not implemented enough.
