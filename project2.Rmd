## **ENVISION - The role of Vitamins**

> Phytoplankton derived dissolved organic matter (DOM) can be readily assimilated by bacterioplankton. The availability of inorganic nutrients and more recently of vitamins has been recognized as limiting factors for auxotrophic phytoplankton growth. However, fundamental understanding on the underlying mechanisms involved in those interactions and the degradation of labile DOM is still rudimentary. Therefore, we conducted mesocsosm experiments with nutrient rich sewater from an upwelling system in the North-East Atlantic Ocean as part of the ENVISION project. In order to study the functional gene expression response of natural microbial assemblages during pre- and postbloom conditions. We infer that such knowledge is crucial for understanding the dynamics, both at the functional gene expression and the community level, of organic matter cycling during pronounced phytoplankton growth.
